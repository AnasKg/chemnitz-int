    2. Write an algorithm that recalculates the
    characters of your name (e.g. Latin alphabet, Klingon, whatever you like)
    into a integer value (A = 1, B = 2, â€¦) and sums up all the values.

    Solution:
    This problem has several solutions.
    The first solution is to use an array of characters,
    where the characters are letters of the Latin alphabet,
    and the indexes of the elements of the array are the integer value of the letter.

    The second solution is to use the asc value of the character.
    For example the ascii code of character 'a' is 97, 'b'=98 ... 'z'=122.
    Let's take any name, for example 'anas', write down the ascii code of each character
        a = 97
        n = 110
        a = 97
        s = 115
    We decrease the ascii code by 96 and as a result we get the integer value of this letter in the alphabet.
        a = 97 - 96 = 1
        n = 110 - 96 = 14
        a = 97 - 96 = 1
        s = 115 - 96 = 19

    In total we get 35
