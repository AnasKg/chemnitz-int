1.  Write an algorithm that creates a chess board array with zeros and ones.
2.  Write an algorithm that recalculates the characters of your name 
    (e.g. Latin alphabet, Klingon, whatever you like) into a integer value (A = 1, B = 2, â€¦) 
    and sums up all the values.
4.  Imagine you have a product to be tested at the end of line. 
    Draw a sketch of the main processes that might be needed and
    propose a SW-architecture that can handle that request.
